# What is a Small To Medium Sized Business?
- Many Sources say between 10-500 employees, though for the purposes of our discussions here I would say more often than not the target business has between 5-100 employees.
- In General SMB Employees where many hats
- Typically No full time IT staff or if there are full time IT staff they are all generalists.
- No full time Security staff.

### The following Rules apply Most of the time though they will not all apply to all SMBs

In an SMB there is generally little to no monitoring of Logs.

In Most SMBs only a very small percentage of Users actually need admin rights to anything.

SMBs rely heavily on outside IT firms to manage or assist in managing their IT resources.

They generally operate a 100% windows environment (though not all have domains).

In small businesses the DC is almost always acting as a file server, and often running applications as well.

There are often no internally developed apps in use.
