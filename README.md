---
The goal of this repository is to create a place where people from any experience or background can come together to work out ideas for securing SMBs. I would like to encourage others to offer their ideas and respectfully challenge ideas presented here, understanding that none of us can see the entire picture. I believe that while businesses in the SMB size do have some significant budgetary and staffing challenges when compared to their medium to large counterparts, they also have some unique advantages in the simplicity of they're businesses.
